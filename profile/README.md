Hello!

Welcome to the Coding Minecraft Community.

We are a small group of friends, who dabble in the art of coding, especially for Minecraft.

Feel free to look at our work, or even make your own changes through forks. Send me a DM (link in bio), or Message Joshy in discord.gg/womenareoverrated (sorry about the name my silly friend made it) if you even wish to join the team!

Josh
